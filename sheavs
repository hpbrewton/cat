# Germs

Suppose that you have two functions $f$ and $g$ defined on the same domain and codomain topologies.
There is a sense in which $f$ and $g$ can be locally equivalent at some $x$,
if there exists some neighborhood of $x$ such that when these two maps are restricted ot that neighborhood that they are equal.
We can use this idea to define an equivalence relation on functions.
Saying that $f \sim_{x} g$ if they have such a neighborhood of equivalence.

# Tangent Bundle

Suppose that you have some smooth function between manifolds, $f$.
And, you want to define its derivative.
Normally, we would define this by assigning to each point the linear operator that best approximates the function at that point.
However, linear operators can not necessarily be defined on the whole of the domain and codomain if they are manifolds.
So, instead we provide linear operators defined on the trangent space of the manifold.
Thus derivatives live not in the same domain and codomain as the manifolds,
but in the domain zippered with the tangents pace at each poin in the domain:

	$TD = \{(x, Tx) : x \in D\}$

# Sheaves, definition

A sheaf is way of attaching information to the open sets of some topology.
To each open set $U$ we associate a set $F(U)$.
This $F$ function must satisfy the following properties:
	- contravariance: if $U$ is a subset of $V$ then there is a function, called the restriction function $F(V) \to F(U)$
	- locality: if two sections of $F(U)$ agree on all their restrictrions to subsets of $U$, then they are in fact equal
	- gluing: if sections exist on for a covering of $U$, that agree when restricted to their pairwise intersections, then there is a section that makes them all agree

# Sheafacation

It can be nicer to deal in sheaves // TODO why?
So, we might want to turn a presheaf into some sheaves.
This process is called sheafication. 
It involves adding the necessary sections to make gluing,
and removing the necessary sections make locality work.
